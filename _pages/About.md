I am a data practitioner with experience in a variety of industries including: Telecommunications, Finance, Research, and Psychology. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology as well as a Master's Degree in Data Science. I am passionate about working with data and using its insights to impact positive outcomes for people. I am interested in artificial intelligence and deep learning. The focus of my recent research has been healthcare, mental health, and social change as these are the areas I am most passionate about.

I am currently working in the Telecommunications Industry but would like to transition into a role within the Healthcare sector.

This has been a wonderful journey so far and I am lucky to have the opportunity to do something I am passionate about. I feel humbled by the experience and knowledge I have gained up to this point and look forward to where the journey will lead me.

Namaste,

Jenn
