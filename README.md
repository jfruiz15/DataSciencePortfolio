### This is an evolving body of work that showcases recently completed projects and will serve as home to future projects.

# Current Project: World Suicide Rates based on Availability of Mental Health Care
For this project, I am examining the how the availability and quality of mental health services effect suicide rates. Country specific data relating to suicide rates, availability of care facilities, and staff availability are all considered. Check back often as this project will be shared in the coming weeks!

# Project One: Cardiovascular Health
For this project, I utilized a random forest classifier and logistic regression model to explore factors indicated as high risk for cardiovascular disease. This could be useful for patient education and improving outcomes for patients with one or more risk factors for the disease. 
I was able to obtain 94% accuracy for the logistic regression model after minimal model tuning. Extensive exploratory analysis was also performed as part of this project.

# Project Two: Airline Safety
This project explored a variety of data visualization methods related to airline safety. 
Visualizations include infographics, posters, and presentations.

# Project Three: Police Shootings in the United States
This project focused on understanding and predicting police shootings in the United States. Used K-Modes Clustering and Regression Analysis to understand key factors that influence shootings. Factors such as mental health, possession of a weapon, and race of assailant were considered in this analysis. This could be useful in de-escalation education and training.

# Project Four: UFO Sightings in the United States
This project used time series analysis, text mining, and DBSCAN clustering to examine UFO Sightings across the United States.

# Project Five: Airbnb in New York City

# Project Six: World Happiness Report

# Project Seven: Bike Shares in Urban London
For this project, the goal was to understand and predict bike shares within London based on a variety of factors. This could be useful in understanding where to invest in infrastructre and alternate transportation within urban areas.

# Project Eight: Weather App
This was my first data science project. The goal was to create a simple weather application that would pull weather data using an API based on user input of location.
