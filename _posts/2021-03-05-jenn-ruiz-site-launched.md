As I am coming to the end of my Master's program, I wanted an easy way to share and showcase my work. Creating this site has been a labor of love. Within these pages you find the projects I am currently working on as well as past projects. Check back often as I will be sharing new projects regularly. This site is - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
