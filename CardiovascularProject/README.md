For this project, I utilized a random forest classifier and logistic regression model to explore factors indicated as high risk for cardiovascular disease. This could be useful for patient education and improving outcomes for patients with one or more risk factors for the disease. I was able to obtain 94% accuracy for the logistic regression model after minimal model tuning. Extensive exploratory analysis was also performed as part of this project.
