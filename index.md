This is an evolving body of work that showcases recently completed projects and will serve as home to future projects. 

My most recent projects have been centered in healthcare, mental health, and social change. These are areas that I am passionate about and hope to make a difference in through data science. Please visit often as I will be uploading new projects soon!
